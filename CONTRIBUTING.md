# Contributing to Shortbread

## Issue management

The Shortbread [steering committee](https://shortbread-tiles.org/#steering-committee) makes decisions on changes to the Shortbread specification. This work is done through Github in pull requests and issues.

Editorial or website changes operate with the
["Fork & Pull"](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) model
and use a four-eyes review mode, meaning that PRs are reviewed by a different person than the author.

### Specification change workflow

1. An issue is opened in [the issue tracker](https://github.com/shortbread-tiles/shortbread-docs/issues) for discussion
2. The issue is discussed and assigned to a milestone based on if it can happen in a minor version or a new major version
3. A change is proposed and voted on by steering committee members. If the steering committee is in favour, it is tagged as accepted
4. When the next version of the specification is released the accepted changes are added
